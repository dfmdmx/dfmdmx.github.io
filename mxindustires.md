Local mini-workshop's with the goal of re-dignifying Mexico's low income housing through digital parametric designed and automated industrial manufactured furniture.

## About
Mexico has long lost the ability to self maintain itself through localized production knowledge....

## Materials and services
**Materials:**  
The list of materials should be as short as possible, they all need to be panel shaped and stored on site.
  * Laminated plywood (Solid colors only)
  * Composite aluminum (Solid colors only)
  * Aluminum 6061 (Natural or sanded)
  * Lexan
  * High density industrial plastics

**Storefront services:**  
The services must be performed on site.
  * 2D CAD/CAM g-code file creation
  * CNC machining
  * Semi-automatic PVC edge banding for laminated plywood

## Initial products
The first approach will be to start with some of the most utilitarian home furniture. It should be designed only with the materials and production methods provided by the workshop. All of these initial product will be delivered as parametric files ready to be lived adjusted for the client and ready to send from the Sales department directly into Manufacturing.  
The initial list:
  * Closet
  * Bathroom/Kitchen sink cabinet
  * Bathroom/Kitchen cabinets
  * Working desk/table
  * Door internal
  * Door external
  * Panel wall
  * Table (not parametric)
  * Chair (not parametric)

## Machines
Machines needed:
  * 1 - CNC machine 250cm x 130cm  - Work machine  
  * 1 - CNC Machine 90cm x 90cm - Desktop machine
  * 1 - CNC mono axis machine for edge drilling
  * 1 - 3D printer
  * 1 - Semi-automatic edge banding machine
  * 1 - Sanding machine +- 450cm cube
  * ........

## Workflow
The workflow divided into manageable segments:
  * **Sales** -  Creates the initial product in the cloud with the design request.
  * **Drawing** - Sees this request from the sales team and returns the cutting time, the process involved and the list of the materials needed. This is only done when a non parametric product is been generated. For example the Initial Products listed above go directly from Sales into Cutting.
  * **Cutting** - This team is the one in charge of machining the g-codes created by the drawing team and preparing the machined parts for the next team.
  * **Edge banding** - This process is only used for some laminated plywood projects.
  * **Packaging** - Involves protecting the work of the others teams for further integration or mailing.  
  * **Assembly** - If necessary this team is the one in charge of assembly and Installation. Assembly depends on Sales.

## Team
The team should be compose of people that reside nearby the workshop and who are capable of performing and improving their job.
