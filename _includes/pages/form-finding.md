>Thinking about Architecture as some intrinsic or emergent system of nature allows us to reduce some of its properties into fundamental variables that can be understood through mathematical models. In this sense, architecture should be shaped alongside scientific knowledge. The scale we have reached as humanity and the amount of information we have gathered about ourselves and our surroundings allows us to use some of the most advanced problem solving techniques, such as genetic algorithms and neural networks into real practical design applications.

I have worked designing and optimizing panelized structures through genetic algorithms. I think the valuable part in using this approach is that it can include a multitude of dimensions in the design process, in this case, a form finding algorithm. Sometimes this complexity resembles the way nature systems stabilize through time.

When combined together, these complex dimensions, namely strength, the use of materials and the manufacturing process, result in a nearly optimal solution, without the need to fully grasp the complexity of the whole system.  I usually work with Python and Rhino Grasshopper to model these geometrical algorithms.
