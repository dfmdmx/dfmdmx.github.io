### I work with two-dimensional manifold surfaces often built in Rhino3D and Python/Grasshopper. I also like to model structural growth algorithms and evolve them (just when I have GPU time). I model and interpret linear vectors, lots of linear vectors (lots as in too many millions my PC is burning!) and triangles, lost of triangles and linear vectors...

I wanted to share my code with the community but specificity of most of my work makes it difficult to solve a functional problem beyond the one it was designed for. So I decided to dissect some of the most useful scripts and Grasshopper definitions into stand-alone software.

I'm an Architect not a Programmer, so you will find errors in both fields. I was more joyfully obligated into publishing my scripts as in motivated to do so. **I have been convinced that the only way we can survive as humanity is by producing and sharing information. Here is my part on sharing.**

## LinCAM3.2 - Rhino3D CAM plugin

### LinCAM 3 Rhino3D plugin transforms 2D geometry into cutting paths for all types of g-code based CNC machines.

It's currently my most mature stand-alone software and it's available for download as a working plugin at [Food4Rhino LinCAM 3](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/lincam3). The source code can be found on the list below.

## Github

### We are going to the artic code vault! I'm quite excited about this project and the fact my software was up there in the right time and got selected for storage. [Here is the Github Artic Vault explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o).

These are my public repositories hosted on GitHub. They are also available on my GitHub profile [https://github.com/dfmdmx](https://github.com/dfmdmx).
