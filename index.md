Title: dfmdmx
---

dfmdmx shares some of the tools derived from the solutions I had implemented in previous proyects as standalone open-source programs. It also host's my work as an Architect and some of my ideas on the way I aproach desig through coding.

Thinking Architecture as some intrinsic or emergent part of the universe allows us to reduce some of its properties into fundamental variables that can be understood throught mathematics and then be shaped by the laws of sciencie. This allows us to use some of the most advance problem solving techniques such as genetic algoriths and neural networks into real practical design applications.
