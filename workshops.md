Production cloud based workshops.


### Linarand
Linarand has been one the leading Mexican companies in the conveyor belt industry for over 35 years. It also has been the main supporter of my research. I started working with them after they sponsored an aluminum CNC machine that I had been designing for a while. After building this machine I automated other manufacturing processes within the factory and was assigned a dedicated warehouse to work alongside their engineering teams.

Once I had a proper CNC machine and a warehouse at my disposal I started working on my first parametric structures, shortly after I realized that machines alone were not sufficient for this task. I needed to control multiple CNC machines from a single controlled unit so I could properly manage the thousands of different parts needed to integrate a parametric structure. This and the need to extend Linarand's new automated processes into their foreign workshops lead to the beginning of the Production Cloud Server and set the foundations for the workshops to come.

Linarand has been my head quarters for the last four years and a launching platform for all my enterprises. Apart from the technical knowledge acquired from them they helped me to understand a company as a whole that starts and ends in the people that sustain it.
