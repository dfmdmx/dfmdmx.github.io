Regarding hardware, I have worked with multi-axis CNCs, lathes and 3D printers. Since parametric manufacturing often involves thousands of different parts that need to be assembled together, I like to control my workshop machines remotely, whenever possible, through a RPI, Arduino or some privative board. This allows me to handle multiple machines and manufacturing lines simultaneously in a single project.

I treat each production step as an independent IOT client that can be controlled and monitored in real time through a server. I usually work with a web-app I coded myself that allows me to quickly deploy or implement the automation for the manufacturing process. This app, in simple words is a g-code file hosting cloud server with a network of connected production machines that can be controlled through a node.js connection.

I developed this web-app from the bits and pieces of software that I wrote for some of my parametric projects. It has proven to be a very efficient tool. I was awarded in 2015 for this web-app with an entrepreneur seed investment prize, in Mexico City. This fund concluded in the creation of two manufacturing companies that run up till today. It is now available as an open-source repository, always in the hope of been furthered developed by the community.

This intrinsic relationship between the machine and the design has allow me to focus on designing efficient and low cost structural geometries by implementing heuristic optimization algorithms. I apply this kind of approach from small scale industrial design to lightweight parametric roofing and fa√ßade structures.

I like to think of this line of work as unique in the way it implements industrial manufacturing automation and parametric design. Somehow I think joining them together may be a way in which we let science permeate more honestly into our everyday design thinking and help future generations make efficient and smart choices regarding the way we use our planet resources.
