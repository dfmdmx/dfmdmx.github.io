Title: dfmdmx

**dfmdmx** shares some of the tools derived from the solutions I had implemented in previous proyects as standalone open-source programs. It also host's my work as an Architect and some of my ideas on the way I aproach desig through coding.

Thinking about Architecture as some intrinsic or emergent part of the universe allows us to reduce some of its properties into fundamental variables that can be understood throught mathematics and then be shaped by the laws of sciencie. The scale we have reach as humanity and the amount of information we have gather about ourselfs and aur surroundings allows us to use some of the most advance problem solving techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks into real practical design applications.
