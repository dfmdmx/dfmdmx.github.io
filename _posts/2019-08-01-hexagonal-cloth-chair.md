**HEX 2.0** is a concept chair design I've been working for a few years now. I first thought about it with Marina Peniche at 2008, a few years later y built it with some modifications. It looked good but it wasn't comfortable. This is my third attempt into finding the right amount of hexagons with the exact amount of tension.

My start approach will be to use to use a mesh relaxation algorithm in Grasshopper's Kangaroo physic's engine and try to design in a more realistic environment. I have a slight intuition of what is wrong with the cloth based on siting in the prototype.

This is the current state of the chair. Sorry for the bad photos, had a backup problem.
