title: Work

Our work is mainly divided in three areas, all of them related to digital manufacturing technologies. The first one is software development and machine automation, its main purpose is to offer a stand-alone platform for the manufacturing process, called The Production Cloud Server.

Based on this platform, we offer a wide variety of everyday use CNC machined products in our local workshops. We also have a pre-built business solution to implement your own business through our MX Industries branch.  

For more advance parametric structure designs we have DFMD Industries, which is mainly oriented in designing efficient and low cost structural geometries by implementing heuristic optimization algorithms. It's a client oriented firm, from small scale industrial design to lightweight parametric roofing and fa√ßade structures.  

We try to manufacture most of our designs through our own family of workshops making this architectural branch unique in the way it implements industrial manufacturing automation and parametric design.
