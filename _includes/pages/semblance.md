### Daniel Fern√°ndez

### My professional experience and interests are mainly oriented in computed assisted form finding and automated machine manufacturing.

I studied Architecture and Urbanism in Mexico City and since early on in my career I have been fascinated with emergent systems and bottom-up design strategies and how to identify, study and replicate them.

I have been lucky to implement this approach professionally. First, in structural analysis, replicating biological systems such as the ones insects use to shape their exoskeleton in a way that make it stronger or more flexible. Second, in design theory, to code space-filling optimization algorithms that replicate the way some flower organelles organize their seeds to optimize the use of material on a CNC bed layout.

Most of my work has been around designing museography for interactive children's museums, and in the past years also manufacturing structures using digital fabrication techniques for museums, and other public spaces. Besides designing the product and the manufacturing process, I often design, code and build the automated machines that I use for production.
