This is a concept test for creating a frame by frame animation using Rhino and Python. It's definitely not the fastest way to create an animation but it may be a useful tool to visualize evolving data through time and have a better understanding of some optimization algorithms strategies within a script.

I was pleased with the time it took to create an individual frame. I will try to further implement it on a genetic algorithm rigid body optimization algorithm that I have been working for a while now.

Here are the videos I made to test the concept. The videos were merge using [Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).
