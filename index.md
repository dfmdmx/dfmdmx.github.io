dfmdmx its a personal attempt to share some of the tools derived from the solutions I had implemented in previous proyects as standalone open-source programs. It also host's my work as an Architect and some of my ideas on the way I aproach desig through coding.

Thinking Architecture as some intrinsic or emergent part of the universe allows us to reduce some of its properties into fundamental laws that can be understood throught mathematics. This allows us to use some of the most advance problem solving techniques such as genetic algoriths and neural networks into real practical design applications.
