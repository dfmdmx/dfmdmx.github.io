# DFMD 
dfmdmx its a personal attempt to share some of the scripts derived from the solutions I had implemented in previous proyects as standalone open-source drawing tools. 

### Work
My work is mainly oriented in computed assited form finding and automated machine manufacturing. The specificity of most of it makes it difficult to solve a functional problem beyond the spectrum it was designed for. With this in mind I think the best aproach into making something useful out of it is to disect some of the never ending scripts and grasshopper definitions into smaller more useful chuncks that can be used for other proyects and by other humans.

### Aknowlegments
Im an Architect not a Programmer, so you will find errors in both fields. I was more joyfully obligated into publishing my scripts as in motivated to show them. I agree the only way we can survive as humanity is by producing and sharing information. Here is my part on sharing.
