# DFMD 
dfmdmx its a personal attempt to share some of the scripts derived from the solutions we had implemented in previous proyects as standalone open-source drawing tools. 

My work is mainly oriented in computed assited form finding and automated machine manufacturing. The specificity of most of it makes its difficult to solve some sort of functional problem beyond the spectrum it was designed for. The aproach is to disect some of the scripts and grasshopper definitions into smaller more useful chuncks.

### Aknowlegments
Im an Architect not a Programmer, so you will find errors in both fields.
