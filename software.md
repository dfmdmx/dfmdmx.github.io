### My work is mainly oriented in computed assisted form finding and automated machine manufacturing.

The specificity of most of it makes it difficult to solve a functional problem beyond the spectrum it was designed for. With this in mind I think the best approach into making something useful out of it is to dissect some of the never ending scripts and grasshopper definitions into smaller more useful chunks that can be used for other projects and by others.

I'm an Architect not a Programmer, so you will find errors in both fields. I was more joyfully obligated into publishing my scripts as in motivated to do so. **I have been convinced that the only way we can survive as humanity is by producing and sharing information. Here is my part on sharing.**

## LinCAM3.2 - Rhino3D CAM plugin

#### LinCAM 3 Rhino3D plugin transforms 2D geometry into cutting paths for all types of g-code based CNC machines.

It's currently my most mature stand-alone software and it's available for download as a working plugin at [Food4Rhino LinCAM 3](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/lincam3). The source code can be found on the list below.

## Github

**We are going to the artic code vault!** I'm quite excited about this project and the fact my software was up there in the right time and got selected for storage. [Here is the Github Artic Vault explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o).

These are my public repositories hosted on GitHub. They are also available on my GitHub profile [https://github.com/dfmdmx](https://github.com/dfmdmx).
