These are some of the machines I have designed for the workshop. They are base on the *DYU Open source maker movement* but can easily accomplish professional works. Its a good starting point for a workshops but I would recommend a newer options from [OpenBuilds](https://openbuildspartstore.com/) or [Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/). All of them are compatible with the [Production Cloud Server](/open-source/#production-cloud-server).

If you are interested in a pre-built business workshop integration please check out [Mx Industries](/projects/2019-07-25-mx-industries.html).
